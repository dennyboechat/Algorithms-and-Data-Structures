- **Quick Sort Average**: 34.49ms per test
- **Merge Sort Average**: 42.30ms per test
- **Performance Advantage**: Quick Sort is ~18% faster on average

### Memory Usage Results
- **Winner**: Quick Sort (25/25 test cases - 100% win rate)
- **Quick Sort Memory**: 0.02 MB average peak usage
- **Merge Sort Memory**: 0.03 MB average peak usage
- **Memory Advantage**: Quick Sort uses ~50% less memory

### Performance Consistency
- **Quick Sort Variability**: 499x ratio (worst/best case)
- **Merge Sort Variability**: 291x ratio (worst/best case)
- **Consistency Winner**: Merge Sort (more predictable performance)

## Dataset-Specific Results

| Dataset Type | Quick Sort Advantage | Key Insight |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Random Data | ✅ Strong | 15-25% faster execution |
| Sorted Data | ✅ Excellent | Up to 65% faster, best-case scenario |
| Reverse Sorted | ✅ Strong | Similar to random data performance |
| Nearly Sorted | ✅ Good | 20-35% faster, real-world advantage |
| Duplicate Heavy | ❌ Poor | Merge Sort wins all cases, QS worst performance |

## Algorithm Strengths Summary

### Quick Sort Excels At:
- General-purpose sorting (random, sorted, nearly-sorted data)
- Memory-constrained environments
- Average-case performance optimization
- Simple implementation requirements

### Merge Sort Excels At:
- Duplicate-heavy datasets
- Requiring stable sorting (preserving equal element order)
- Predictable performance requirements
- Guaranteed O(n log n) behavior

## Practical Recommendations

**Use Quick Sort for**:
- Most general applications (wins 80% of test cases)
- Memory-limited systems (50% less memory usage)
- Performance-critical applications where average case matters most

**Use Merge Sort for**:
- Applications requiring stable sorting
- Real-time systems needing predictable performance
- Data with many duplicate values
- When worst-case guarantees are essential

## Conclusion

Quick Sort emerges as the overall winner with superior speed and memory efficiency in most scenarios. However, Merge Sort's consistency and specialized strengths make it irreplaceable for specific use cases. The choice should be based on your specific requirements for performance predictability, memory constraints, and data characteristics.
