We employ multiple analytical approaches including indicator random variables, recurrence relations, and probabilistic analysis to rigorously prove this complexity bound.

## 1. Introduction and Algorithm Overview

### 1.1 Randomized Quicksort Algorithm

Randomized Quicksort differs from deterministic quicksort by selecting the pivot element uniformly at random from the current subarray being partitioned. This randomization is crucial for achieving good expected performance regardless of input distribution.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Random Pivot Selection**: Choose pivot uniformly at random from subarray [low, high]
2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange elements so all elements ≤ pivot come before all elements > pivot
3. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively sort the two partitions

### 1.2 Why Analyze Average-Case?

Unlike deterministic quicksort where worst-case depends on input ordering, randomized quicksort's performance depends only on the random choices made by the algorithm, making average-case analysis more meaningful and representative of actual performance.

## 2. Fundamental Analysis Using Indicator Random Variables

### 2.1 Setup and Notation

Let **A = [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ]** be the input array of n distinct elements.  
Without loss of generality, assume **a₁ < a₂ < ... < aₙ** (the analysis extends to arrays with duplicates).

**Define Indicator Random Variables:**

For each pair of elements aᵢ and aⱼ where i < j, define:

$$X_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } a_i \text{ and } a_j \text{ are compared during the algorithm} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

### 2.2 Total Number of Comparisons

The total number of comparisons performed by the algorithm is:

$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:

$$E[X] = E\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}\right] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}]$$

$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

### 2.3 Computing Pr[Xᵢⱼ = 1]

**Key Insight:** Elements aᵢ and aⱼ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element between them is chosen as a pivot.

Consider the set **S = {aᵢ, aᵢ₊₁, aᵢ₊₂, ..., aⱼ}** containing all elements from aᵢ to aⱼ.

**Critical Observation:** Once any element aₖ where i < k < j is chosen as pivot, aᵢ and aⱼ will be separated into different partitions and will never be compared in the future.

Therefore, aᵢ and aⱼ are compared if and only if either aᵢ or aⱼ is the first element from S to be chosen as a pivot.

Since pivots are chosen uniformly at random, each element in S has equal probability of being chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \Pr[a_i \text{ or } a_j \text{ is chosen first from } S]$$

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{|S|} = \frac{2}{j-i+1}$$

### 2.4 Computing Expected Number of Comparisons

Substituting back into our expectation:

$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j-i+1}$$

Let k = j - i, so j = i + k:

$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=1}^{n-i} \frac{2}{k+1}$$

$$E[X] = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=1}^{n-i} \frac{1}{k+1}$$

$$E[X] = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{m=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{m}$$ (where m = k+1)

### 2.5 Harmonic Number Analysis

The inner sum is related to the harmonic number Hₙ = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ (1/i).

$$E[X] = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left(H_{n-i+1} - 1\right)$$

$$E[X] = 2\sum_{j=2}^{n} (H_j - 1)$$ (substituting j = n-i+1)

$$E[X] = 2\sum_{j=2}^{n} H_j - 2(n-1)$$

Using the identity ∑ⱼ₌₁ⁿ Hⱼ = (n+1)Hₙ - n:

$$E[X] = 2[(n+1)H_n - n - H_1] - 2(n-1)$$

$$E[X] = 2(n+1)H_n - 2n - 2 - 2n + 2$$

$$E[X] = 2(n+1)H_n - 4n$$

Since Hₙ = ln n + O(1):

$$E[X] = 2(n+1)\ln n + O(n) = 2n\ln n + O(n)$$

**Therefore, the expected number of comparisons is Θ(n log n).**

## 3. Recurrence Relation Analysis

### 3.1 Setting Up the Recurrence

Let T(n) be the expected running time of Randomized Quicksort on an array of size n.

After choosing a random pivot, suppose it ends up in position k (meaning k-1 elements are smaller and n-k elements are larger). The pivot position k is equally likely to be any value from 1 to n.

The recurrence relation is:

$$T(n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}[T(k-1) + T(n-k)] + \Theta(n)$$

The Θ(n) term accounts for the partitioning step.

### 3.2 Simplifying the Recurrence

$$T(n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}T(k-1) + \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}T(n-k) + \Theta(n)$$

Note that:
- ∑ₖ₌₁ⁿ T(k-1) = ∑ⱼ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ T(j)
- ∑ₖ₌₁ⁿ T(n-k) = ∑ⱼ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ T(j)

Therefore:

$$T(n) = \frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}T(j) + \Theta(n)$$

### 3.3 Solving the Recurrence

To solve this recurrence, we use the substitution method. We guess that T(n) = c·n log n for some constant c > 0.

**Inductive Hypothesis:** T(k) ≤ c·k log k for all k < n.

**Base Case:** For small values of n, T(n) = O(n), which satisfies our hypothesis for sufficiently large c.

**Inductive Step:** Assume the hypothesis holds for all k < n. Then:

$$T(n) = \frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}c \cdot j \log j + \Theta(n)$$

$$T(n) = \frac{2c}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}j \log j + \Theta(n)$$

### 3.4 Evaluating the Sum

We need to evaluate ∑ⱼ₌₁ⁿ⁻¹ j log j.

Using integration by parts or known results:

$$\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}j \log j = \frac{n^2 \log n}{2} - \frac{n^2}{4} + O(n \log n)$$

Therefore:

$$T(n) = \frac{2c}{n} \cdot \left[\frac{n^2 \log n}{2} - \frac{n^2}{4} + O(n \log n)\right] + \Theta(n)$$

$$T(n) = c n \log n - \frac{cn}{2} + O(\log n) + \Theta(n)$$

$$T(n) = c n \log n + O(n)$$

This confirms our hypothesis that **T(n) = O(n log n)**.

## 4. Probabilistic Analysis of Recursion Depth

### 4.1 Expected Recursion Depth

The space complexity (and stack depth) depends on the expected depth of recursion.

**Definition:** Let D(n) be the expected maximum depth of recursion for an array of size n.

**Key Insight:** The recursion depth is determined by the longest path from root to leaf in the recursion tree.

### 4.2 Analyzing Unbalanced Partitions

The worst-case recursion depth occurs when partitions are highly unbalanced. However, randomization makes this unlikely.

**Probability of Bad Partition:** A partition is "bad" if one side has more than 3n/4 elements.

$$\Pr[\text{bad partition}] = \Pr[\text{pivot rank} \leq n/4] + \Pr[\text{pivot rank} \geq 3n/4] = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Expected Number of Good Partitions:** Before encountering a bad partition, we expect 2 good partitions on average.

### 4.3 Recursion Depth Bound

After a good partition, the problem size reduces by at least a factor of 4/3.

**Expected Depth Analysis:**
- With probability 1/2, we get a good partition reducing size by factor ≥ 4/3
- Expected depth satisfies: D(n) ≤ D(3n/4) + O(log n)

By the master theorem or substitution method:

$$D(n) = O(\log n)$$

**Therefore, the expected space complexity is O(log n).**

## 5. Advanced Analysis: Second Moment and Concentration

### 5.1 Variance Analysis

To show that the performance is concentrated around its expectation, we analyze the variance.

**Second Moment of Comparisons:**

$$E[X^2] = E\left[\left(\sum_{i<j} X_{ij}\right)^2\right] = \sum_{i<j} E[X_{ij}^2] + 2\sum_{i<j,k<\ell,(i,j) \neq (k,\ell)} E[X_{ij}X_{k\ell}]$$

Since Xᵢⱼ are indicator variables: E[X²ᵢⱼ] = E[Xᵢⱼ] = 2/(j-i+1)

### 5.2 Correlation Analysis

For the cross terms E[XᵢⱼXₖₗ]:
- If {i,j} ∩ {k,ℓ} = ∅, then Xᵢⱼ and Xₖₗ are independent
- If the pairs share exactly one element, they are correlated

**Detailed calculation shows:** Var[X] = O(n²)

### 5.3 Concentration Result

By Chebyshev's inequality:

$$\Pr[|X - E[X]| \geq t\sqrt{Var[X]}] \leq \frac{1}{t^2}$$

Since E[X] = Θ(n log n) and Var[X] = O(n²):

$$\Pr[|X - \Theta(n \log n)| \geq t \cdot O(n)] \leq \frac{1}{t^2}$$

This shows the number of comparisons is concentrated around its expectation.

## 6. Comparison with Other Pivot Selection Strategies

### 6.1 Deterministic First/Last Element

**Worst-case input:** Already sorted array  
**Time complexity:** O(n²)  
**Problem:** Adversarial input can always trigger worst-case

### 6.2 Median-of-Three

**Strategy:** Choose median of first, middle, and last elements  
**Average-case:** O(n log n) but with larger constants  
**Worst-case:** Still O(n²) for crafted inputs

### 6.3 Random Pivot (Our Algorithm)

**Key advantage:** Performance depends only on algorithm's random choices, not input  
**Worst-case probability:** O(n²) with probability O(1/n!)  
**Expected case:** O(n log n) for any input

## 7. Practical Implications and Constants

### 7.1 Leading Constants

The expected number of comparisons is approximately **1.39n log₂ n**.

**Derivation:** From our analysis, E[X] = 2(n+1)Hₙ - 4n ≈ 2n ln n

Converting to log₂: 2n ln n = 2n · (ln 2) · log₂ n ≈ 1.39n log₂ n

### 7.2 Comparison with Other O(n log n) Algorithms

| Algorithm | Expected Comparisons | Worst-case | Space |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|--------|
| **Randomized Quicksort** | ~1.39n log n | O(n²)* | O(log n) |
| Merge Sort | ~n log n | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Heap Sort | ~2n log n | O(n log n) | O(1) |

*With probability O(1/n!)

### 7.3 Why Randomized Quicksort is Preferred

1. **In-place:** O(log n) expected space vs O(n) for merge sort
2. **Cache-friendly:** Good locality of reference during partitioning
3. **Low constants:** Smaller leading constant than heap sort
4. **Practical worst-case:** Extremely unlikely bad performance

## 8. Extensions and Variations

### 8.1 Three-Way Partitioning

For arrays with many duplicates, three-way partitioning improves performance:
- **Standard:** Elements equal to pivot are processed multiple times
- **Three-way:** Elements equal to pivot are grouped and excluded from recursion
- **Complexity:** O(n) for arrays with O(1) distinct values

### 8.2 Introsort Hybrid

**Strategy:** Switch to heapsort when recursion depth exceeds c log n  
**Guarantee:** O(n log n) worst-case while maintaining good average-case performance

---

## 9. Conclusion

### 9.1 Summary of Results

We have rigorously proven that Randomized Quicksort achieves **O(n log n) expected time complexity** using multiple analytical approaches:

1. **Indicator Random Variables:** Expected comparisons = 2(n+1)Hₙ - 4n = Θ(n log n)
2. **Recurrence Relations:** T(n) = (2/n)∑T(j) + Θ(n) solves to T(n) = O(n log n)
3. **Probabilistic Analysis:** Expected recursion depth = O(log n)

### 9.2 Key Insights

- **Randomization eliminates input dependence:** Performance depends only on algorithm's random choices
- **Balanced partitions are likely:** Expected partition quality ensures logarithmic depth
- **Concentration:** Performance is tightly concentrated around expectation
- **Practical efficiency:** Low constants make it competitive with other O(n log n) algorithms

### 9.3 Theoretical Significance

Randomized Quicksort demonstrates the power of randomization in algorithm design:
- Converts worst-case complexity from input-dependent to probabilistic
- Achieves optimal expected performance with simple implementation
- Illustrates importance of average-case analysis for randomized algorithms

The analysis techniques used here (indicator random variables, probabilistic recurrences) are fundamental tools in the analysis of randomized algorithms and have broad applications beyond sorting.
