# Matrix Multiplication Project Requirements
# MSCS 532 - Final Project

# No external dependencies required for the core implementation
# The project uses only Python standard library

# For development and testing (optional):
# pytest>=7.0.0  # Alternative testing framework
# numpy>=1.21.0  # For performance comparison (optional)
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For visualization (optional)

# This project is designed to work with Python 3.7+ and uses only built-in modules:
# - unittest (for testing)
# - time (for performance measurement)
# - random (for random matrix generation)
# - sys, os (for path management in tests)
